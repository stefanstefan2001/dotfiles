## Initial Setup and Installation

If on OSX, you will need to install the XCode CLI tools before continuing. To do so, open a terminal and type

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Then, clone the dotfiles repository to your computer. This can be placed anywhere, and symbolic links will be created to reference it from your home directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stefanstefan2001/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` will start by initializing the submodules used by this repository. Then, it will install all symbolic links into your home directory. Every file with a `.symlink` extension will be symlinked to the home directory with a `.` in front of it. As an example, `vimrc.symlink` will be symlinked in the home directory as `~/.vimrc`. Then, this script will create a `~/.vim-tmp` directory in your home directory, as this is where vim is configured to place its temporary files. Additionally, all files in the `$DOTFILES/config` directory will be symlinked to the `~/.config/` directory for applications that follow the [XDG base directory specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html), such as neovim.

Next, the isntall script will perform a check to see if it is running on an OSX machine. If so, it will install Homebrew if it is not currently installed and will install the homebrew packages listed in [`brew.sh`](install/brew.sh). Then, it will run [`installosx.sh`](installosx.sh) and change some OSX configurations. This file is pretty well documented and so it is advised that you __read through and comment out any changes you do not want__. Next, the script will call [`install/nvm.sh`](install/nvm.sh) to install Node.js (stable) using nvm.

## ZSH Setup

ZSH is configured in the `zshrc.symlink` file, which will be symlinked to the home directory. The following occurs in this file:


* set the `EDITOR` to nvim
* Load any `~/.terminfo` setup
* Set the `CODE_DIR` variable, pointing to the location where the code projects exist for exclusive autocompletion with the `c` command
* Recursively search the `$DOTFILES/zsh` directory for files ending in .zsh and source them
* source a `~/.localrc` if it exists so that additional configurations can be made that won't be kept track of in this dotfiles repo. This is good for things like API keys, etc.
* Add the `~/bin` and `$DOTFILES/bin` directories to the path
* Setup NVM, RVM, and hub if they exist
* Set the base16 colorscheme to use for both the terminal (iTerm2) and vim/neovim by exporting the `$THEME` and `$BACKGROUND` environment variables
* And more...
 

## Vim and Neovim Setup

vim and neovim should just work once the correct plugins are installed. To install the plugins, you will need to open vim/neovim in the following way:

for vim
```bash
vim +PlugInstall
```

for neovim
```bash
nvim +PlugInstall
```

### Fonts

I am currently using [Hack](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) as my default font, which does include Powerline support, so you don't need an additional patched font. In addition to this, I do have [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) installed and configured to be used for non-ascii characters. If you would prefer not to do this, then simply remove the `Plug 'ryanoasis/vim-devicons'` plugin from vim/nvim


## TPM


### Installing plugins

1. Add new plugin to `~/.tmux.conf` with `set -g @plugin '...'`
2. Press `prefix + I` (capital I, as in **I**nstall) to fetch the plugin.

You're good to go! The plugin was cloned to `~/.tmux/plugins/` dir and sourced.

### Uninstalling plugins

1. Remove (or comment out) plugin from the list.
2. Press `prefix + alt + u` (lowercase u as in **u**ninstall) to remove the plugin.

All the plugins are installed to `~/.tmux/plugins/` so alternatively you can
find plugin directory there and remove it.

### Key bindings

`prefix + I`
- Installs new plugins from GitHub or any other git repository
- Refreshes TMUX environment

`prefix + U`
- updates plugin(s)

`prefix + alt + u`
- remove/uninstall plugins not on the plugin list

## ZSH Plugins

By default, the `.zshrc` file will source any file within `.dotfiles/zsh` that have the `.zsh` extension.

## Vim Plugins

Vim plugins are managed with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). To install, run `vim +PlugInstall`.
